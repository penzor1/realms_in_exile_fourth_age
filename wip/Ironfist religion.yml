 faith_ironfists_desc:0 "The [ironfists|E] follow a path of solemn reverence to [mahal|E], the Great Smith, and Creator of Dwarvenkind. Once torn asunder by their King’s treachery, the Ironfists have learned that it is through hard work, humility, and perseverance that the soul is made pure again.\n\nTheir faith is not one of grand rituals or showy displays, but of quiet, steadfast dedication to craft. Every hammer strike, every chisel’s edge, and every stone laid is an act of piety. The Ironfists seek redemption through their deeds, knowing that their true worth is not measured by the gold in their coffers, but by the strength of their work and the integrity of their hearts.n\nThe Ironfists value unity over individual glory, building for their clan, not for kings, and they trust that, in the end, their deeds will speak louder than words. As they toil in silence, they know that one day, when the Final Battle comes, they will not fight for dominion but for the dignity of their people and the grace of Mahal’s forgiveness."
