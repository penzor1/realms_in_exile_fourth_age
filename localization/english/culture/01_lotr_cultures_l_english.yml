 hyarmenedain_desc:0 "#size:15    After the reconquest of [umbar|E] by High King Elessar, with their corsairs and Câssimirioni-aligned nobility sent to sea-depths of [ulmocharacter|E], the Adûnaic descendents of the port havens were fearful of their new overlords. Yet in the spirit of conciliation, Elessar forgave those who accepted defeat and recognized the leadership authority of the Reunited Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor and a peaceful cohabitation was realized.\n\nSlowly numbers of [gondorian|E] and Harondorim settlers would arrive - traders, administrators, and those seeking a new life in the latest southern province of [gondor|E]. This migration gave birth to a new Umbarean culture, one that heavily took after its [gondorian|E] overlords yet maintained some aspects of the ancient customs of the haven. These were the Hyarmenedain, and their melded history and heritage gave them a unique and invigorated spirit reminiscent of the ancient Dúnedain of the south.#!"
