 umbarrim_desc: "After the reconquest of [umbar|E] by High King Elessar, with their corsairs and Câssimirioni-aligned nobility sent to the sea-depths of [ulmocharacter|E], the Adûnaic descendants of the port havens were fearful of their new overlords. Yet in the spirit of conciliation, Elessar forgave those who accepted defeat and recognised the rule of the Reunited Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor. A fragile, yet peaceful cohabitation followed.\n\nSlowly numbers of [gondorian|E] and Harondorim settlers would arrive - traders, administrators, and those seeking a new life in the latest southern province of [gondor|E]. This migration gave birth to a new Umbarean culture, one that heavily took after its [gondorian|E] overlords yet maintained some aspects of the ancient customs of the haven. From this mingling was born a new Umbarean culture: the Umbarrim. Though shaped by their [gondorian|E] overlords, they preserved fragments of the old haven’s customs. Their blended heritage fostered a unique and revitalised spirit, echoing the ancient Dúnedain of the South."
