 umbarrim_desc: "#size:15    After the reconquest of [umbar|E] by High King Elessar, with their corsairs and Câssimirioni-aligned nobility sent to the sea-depths of [ulmocharacter|E], the Adûnaic descendants of the port havens were fearful of their new overlords. Yet in the spirit of conciliation, Elessar forgave those who accepted defeat and recognised the rule of the Reunited Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor. A fragile, yet peaceful cohabitation followed.\n\nSlowly numbers of [gondorian|E] and Harondorim settlers would arrive - traders, administrators, and those seeking a new life in the latest southern province of [gondor|E]. This migration gave birth to a new Umbarean culture, one that heavily took after its [gondorian|E] overlords yet maintained some aspects of the ancient customs of the haven. From this mingling was born a new Umbarean culture: the Umbarrim. Though shaped by their [gondorian|E] overlords, they preserved fragments of the old haven’s customs. Their blended heritage fostered a unique and revitalised spirit, echoing the ancient Dúnedain of the South.#!"

 hill_troll_desc: "#size:15    Hill Trolls could be encountered in the wilderlands of [middleearth|E]. Like most trolls, they were exceptionally stupid by most standards. By the late [thirdage|E], they had become very rare. They lived in caves and burrows, for the sun turned their skin to stone.#!"
 cave_troll_desc: "#size:15    Cave Trolls could only be encountered deep beneath the mountains of [middleearth|E]. They were mostly isolationist, content to dwell in the deep caverns and grottos beneath the world, but could rarely be persuaded to join [orcish|E] warbands with large amounts of food.#!"
 snow_troll_desc: "#size:15    Snow Trolls could only be encountered in the furthest northern reaches of [middleearth|E], where [angband|E] once stood. They were exceptionally rare, and only a handful of them were known to roam in the expansive frozen plains and tundra of Forodwaith.#!"
 black_troll_desc: "#size:15    The Olog-hai, or Black Trolls, were brutal war machines bred by [sauroncharacter|E] to bolster the armies of [mordor|E]. They were marginally more intelligent than most trolls. They were the only servants of the eye to truly adopt Black Speech as their dominant language, taking pride in the use of the Dark Lord's tongue.#!"
 sand_troll_desc: "#size:15    Sand Trolls could be encountered in the far south of [middleearth|E]. Few of them were known to live in the arid drylands of [harad|E] and the dense jungles of the [bayoftulwang|E], and perhaps further beyond in the Utter South.#!"
