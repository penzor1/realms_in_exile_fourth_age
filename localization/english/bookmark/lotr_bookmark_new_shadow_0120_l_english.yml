An age, that was expected to bring peace and prosperity to all of [middleearth|E]. With the passing of High King Elessar and the departure of his blessed mother, the Edain now turn to him for wisdom and direction. Expectations that weigh heavily upon him.\n\nHe is not alone, however. His wife Nessanie, his brilliant sons, and his loyal vassals will hopefully help bring about the prosperous future that holds the pillars of his realm together."

Born into the royal bloodline of both the Edain and the ancient Númenóreans, he is being groomed for a role that will shape the future of the Reunited Kingdom. While his father, Eldarion, holds the throne, Elendil's time to rule has not yet come. As the kingdom flourishes, the young heir’s days are filled with preparation, learning the intricacies of leadership, and navigating the complexities of a realm in transition.\n\nThough the shadow of his grandfather Elessar’s legacy looms large, Elendil must carve his own path, ensuring that the strength of the Reunited Kingdom endures when his time arrives."

King Éofara, son of Elfwine, with his son Prince Éobrand by his side, do their best to better the livelihood of their people. The folk are hardy, but they struggle for bread.\n\nThe King faces a dilemma; should he safeguard his people's warrior culture, or adopt the more sedentary ways of the Edain of [gondor|E]?"
