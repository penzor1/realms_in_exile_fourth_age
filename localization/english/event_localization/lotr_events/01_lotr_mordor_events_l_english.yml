 01_mordor.1001.desc:0 "Voices, voices... They led me throughout the plains of [nurn|E] and the [landofshadows|E]. Chasing shadows and trails of darkness. My men look at me with suspicion, but they do not know what is at stake. There is something more, something further.\nToday the voices led me to a dark-stoned, soot-blackened tower. I came across evidence of a great battle with [orcs|E], their scattered refuse marking the site. The plains have largely been cleansed of their filth. The people of [gondor|E] celebrate Cormarë, Ringday, to remember the fall of Barad-dûr. It was near the remnants of that tower where I found it. A black sphere. Heavy yet lithe. I have an inkling of what it is, an ancient [palantir|E]. Dangerous...\nIn my tent, I study scrolls and maps to understand the lava-rock terrain. My gaze drifts to the black sphere on my desk. It makes me uneasy, and though I’ve not yet looked into it, it whispers to me... About other ruins, more items, more relics. \n#help 'My lord, are you sure about this? Should we not tell [minasanor|E] about this.. thing?'#!"
