 ns_lotr_intro_events.6207.desc:0 "Voices, voices... They led me throughout the plains of [nurn|E] and the [landofshadows|E]. Chasing shadows and trails of darkness. My men look at me with suspicion, but they do not know what is at stake. There is something more, something further.\nToday the voices led me to a dark-stoned, soot-blackened tower. I came across evidence of a great battle with [orcs|E], their scattered refuse marking the site. The plains have largely been cleansed of their filth. The people of [gondor|E] celebrate Cormarë, Ringday, to remember the fall of Barad-dûr. It was near the remnants of that tower where I found it. A black sphere. Heavy yet lithe. I have an inkling of what it is, an ancient [palantir|E]. Dangerous...\nIn my tent, I study scrolls and maps to understand the lava-rock terrain. My gaze drifts to the black sphere on my desk. It makes me uneasy, and though I’ve not yet looked into it, it whispers to me... About other ruins, more items, more relics. \n#help 'My lord, are you sure about this? Should we not tell [minasanor|E] about this.. thing?'#!"

My men follow you still, despite my trespasses. But now, I have gone too far to not understand what all of this is about. Armed men, and some women, are before me. A host clad in ancient armour, with painted red eyes and other sigils I do not recognise.\nA female voice murmurs, from one bowed low like all of them.\n#help 'Great Prince, we are rightful sons and daughters of [elenna|E].\nOf the [bloodofnumenor|E], like you,'#!\nI contemplate for a moment before responding.\n#help 'I am not like you, I am Prince Eldacar, son of Eldarion, the King of [gondor|E] and [arnor|E]. Do not call me your equal.#!'\nShe pauses, giving a brief look.\n#help 'Of course, my Lord. We are your servants. Yours to command.'\n'Do you hear [zigur|E], my Lord? He… they taught us many unnatural things. And I can teach them to you, as our new Black Lord.'#!\nMy Rangers' disapproval becomes louder still.\n#help 'No! This is blasphemy, devilry, madness!'#! \nIs it? The whispers have led me right so far. Right to Darkness."
