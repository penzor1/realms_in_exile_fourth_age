Though quieter than before, there’s still peace, as if winter’s chill has melted away with the first warmth of spring.\n\nThe realm feels emptier, many of his kin having sailed west. Yet, there’s a subtle joy in this quietude, a peace the world hasn’t known for ages. The trees stand tall again, the Bruinen glistens in the spring warmth, and even in silence, there’s a melody—a remembrance of when Imladris was a beacon for those seeking refuge.\n\nHis father, [elrondshort|E], is gone, and the weight of leadership now rests on him. His sister Arwen grieves Elessar’s loss, and he often thinks of her. But the task ahead remains clear: to ensure the [elves|E]' legacy endures, even as Men’s age unfolds.\n\nThe world feels different, and though the old age fades, there may still be time for the [elves|E] to leave their mark."

The once vibrant realm now rests in peaceful repose, with echoes of a past age in the trees. The rustling of leaves fills the air, the forest bathed in the light of a setting sun. The weight of centuries rests in every branch, every root, as if the land feels the passing of time.\n\n[lothlorien|E]'s beauty remains, but it is tinged with sorrow. Most of his kin have sailed west, leaving behind the land that flourished under Galadriel and Celeborn. Only a few remain, and the forest feels lonelier than before. Yet there is peace, knowing [sauroncharacter|E]’s shadow has passed.\n\nElrohir thinks of his brother, Elladan, in [imladris|E], and his father, [elrondshort|E], who has sailed west. The mantle of leadership now falls on him in [lothlorien|E]. His thoughts turn to Arwen, grieving Elessar, and the uncertain future of the [elves|E].\n\nThe trees stand as a testament to his people’s endurance, but Elrohir knows the time has come for the [elves|E] to find their place in the new world.

He had expected to find [orcs|E] lurking in the mountains or trolls lumbering in the hills. Yet the land of [eriador|E] is empty. No foes remain, except for those in the Hithaeglir, the Misty Mountains, and beyond. \n\nAs he rides through the ruins of old Elven settlements, past broken towers and empty halls, another thought takes root. The [eldar|E] may be few, but must their works be left to fade? Could Eriador be more than a land of ghosts and scattered [men|E]? The time may soon come to decide.\n\nShould the past be reclaimed, be left to memory or will his ambitions surpass the realms of Eriador?"

After long years apart, the sight of her stirs something deep within me.\nArwen steps forward, weary but steady. The loss of Elessar is fresh, and though we are kin, grief holds part of her distant. I speak first, my voice low.\n#help 'It has been long since last we stood together, Arwen.

The stars shine brightly above the mallorn trees, yet the song of the Elves fades, with fewer voices in Caras Galadhon.\n\nAs Warden of Lothlórien, Haldir remains steadfast in his duty. The realm is safe, though its protection now guards against a diminished enemy. Many of his kin have sailed west, leaving the land empty. Those who remain are scattered, their voices silent, searching for their place in a world where their kind no longer thrives.\n\nHaldir stands at the borders of Lothlórien, feeling the weight of peace, but also the absence of those who once filled this place. Even in this sacred wood, the time of the Elves seems to be nearing its end. The future is uncertain, and the wood stands still, as unchanging as the ageless trees sheltering it."

 ns_lotr_intro_events.0036.desc:0 "Elessar has passed, and the weight of his loss settles upon Legolas like a shadow. He recalls the many roads they walked together, the battles fought, the hardships endured side by side. The Fellowship, once united by oaths and deep friendship, now lies scattered across the lands. Boromir has long passed into memory, and so too have Peregrin and Meriadoc. Mithrandir, Frodo, Sam, and Bilbo have sailed across the Sea, leaving only echoes of their deeds and the warmth of their shared days. Gimli, steadfast and loyal, still walks the land, one of the last of the Fellowship to remain, his bond with Legolas unbroken.\n\nThe call of the West stirs in Legolas’s heart, but the thought of leaving without his dearest friend, without the companionship that saw them through so much, fills him with sorrow.

 ns_lotr_intro_events.2001.desc:0 "In the Glittering Caves of Aglarond, where forge fires glimmer upon the stone, Gimli, son of Glóin, continue to reign as lord and guardian. His hands, calloused by years of craft, shape the stone into a realm that echoes with strength and beauty. Once a sanctuary, the caves now stand as a testament to [dwarven|E] steadfastness.\n\nUnder his rule, the Glittering Caves have flourished, a kingdom where art and industry thrive. The halls shine with intricate carvings and ornate metalwork, each piece reflecting his reverence for Lady Galadriel, whose memory endures in every shining surface, every beam of light. Those who enter do so with awe, for it is not just a home, but a legacy.\n\nNow, with Elessar, the true King of [men|E], gone, the world beyond the Glittering Caves faces uncertain days. Though ancient, Gimli remains resolute. He has crafted a realm of enduring strength, but even the hardiest of Dwarves cannot outlast time. What lies ahead, he does not know, but his hands have not yet stilled. And so, the Caves will echo with hammer and chisel, carving his people's legacy into the earth."

That reverence, that vision of splendour, has not been forgotten. The White Mountains rise high, their depths rich with untapped promise. With Sauron vanquished, the time has come to shape something greater.\n\nThe halls of the White Mountains shall ring with the sounds of hammer and chisel, of forges blazing, shaping stone to purpose.

Now, through fate’s strange turn, Hreithmar, a distant kin from Dwálin’s line, finds himself the ruler of the Broadbeams.\n\nHis claim was unexpected, yet the legacy he inherits is one of resilience and strength. The Broadbeams, once mighty among the dwarven clans, have long endured without a homeland of their own. While the Longbeards turn their gaze toward Khazad-dûm, Hreithmar’s people look to their own past—to the lost halls of Belegost, where their forefathers once ruled with pride.\n\nThe road ahead is uncertain, and the burdens of kingship weigh heavily upon him.

Olius, a distant offshoot of Úri’s line, sits the throne not by strength but by necessity. True power lies elsewhere.\n\nÓin, son of Eldberk, walks the stone corridors of his hold with measured steps, each decision weaving his will deeper into the fabric of power. All know that when Olius draws his last breath, there will be no need for pretense. Buzrâdûm will be his.\n\nYet the past is not so easily buried. Eldberk’s feud with Úri VI cast a long shadow, and though Úri VI met a suspicious end, his sons remain. Frain and Ón, exiled to Zillînakhur, the very refuge Eldberk once sought, have lost their home but not their will. Exile is but a test of patience. To Óin’s sympathisers, they are remnants of a dying claim, their cause broken beyond repair. To his rivals, they are heirs in waiting, biding their time. But such men have risen before.

The [dwarves|E] remember it was Eldberk whose schemes led to the fall of Frain’s own father and rightful ruler of the [firebeards|E], Úri VI.\n\nFrain, lawful heir of Buzrâ-dûm, walks the stony paths of Zillînakhur, the same refuge where Eldberk once withdrew. The land is one of exile and shame, a bitter reminder of what was lost. His brother Ón stands beside him, both bound by a legacy their enemies thought would fade with time. But neither will forget the treachery that led to their father's untimely death under mysterious circumstances.\n\nThose who stole the throne from his father believe they can erase his line with silence and years of waiting. But Frain is a son of Úri, and sons of Úri do not forget. Buzrâ-dûm will be his again — whether by reclaiming it through force or watching his enemies falter beneath their own betrayals."

Now, the remnants of these ancient realms lie in ruin, but the desire to restore dwarven glory endures.\n\nThough [orcs|E] and [goblins|E] still lurk in the shadows of the Grey Mountains, Kili knows that the time to reclaim his ancestors' lands may be near.

The Line of Ashmog shall rise once more, driven by vengeance.\n\nBoldog remembers the terror of Azog ‘the Defiler’ and Bolg, the dread their names inspired.

Now, with his father’s killer, Bolgakh the Hammer, in control of Old Moria, Mazog II has carved out a new domain in the north, biding his time and waiting for an opportunity to reclaim his birthright.\n\nDuring the same battle that saw his father slain by Bolgakh, Mazog II struck down Burthrakh, son of Bolgakh, a small but significant victory.\n\nIn his years of exile, Mazog has become more cunning, ruthless, and determined.

Yet, Bolgakh’s thirst for power is unquenched, and his ambitions extend far beyond the dark halls of Moria.\n\nAs age creeps upon him, Bolgakh turns his gaze to the Misty Mountains, determined to bring the entire territory under his iron grip. But with his strength fading, his grandson, Bolgakh the Younger, waits in the shadows, eager to rise. Driven by hatred for Mazog II and his killing of Bolgakh the Younger’s father, Burthrakh, he is a fury waiting to be unleashed.\n\nBolgakh the Hammer knows his days are numbered, and soon it will be his grandson who will carry on the Hammer’s legacy, sweeping through the mountains and leaving a trail of death in his wake."
