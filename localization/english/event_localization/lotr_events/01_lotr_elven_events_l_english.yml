 01_elven.0036.t:0 "The Sea's Call" # Legolas Intro # By Jagua
 01_elven.0036.desc:0 "Elessar has passed. You recall the many roads you walked together with him, the battles fought, the hardships endured side by side. The Fellowship once stood united, bound by oaths and friendship, yet now only echoes remain. Mithrandir, Frodo and Bilbo have long since departed across the Sea. Gimli still walks this land, the last of those bonds unbroken.\n\nThe call of the West stirs within you, but could you bear to leave without your dearest friend accompanying you to Valinor? Or does Middle-earth yet hold something worth staying for?"
 01_elven.0036.a:0 "The Sea calls, and I must answer!"
 01_elven.0036.a.tt:0 "You choose to sail west to Valinor alone.\nYou continue as Thranduil."
 01_elven.0036.b:0 "I will go, and Gimli shall join me!"
 01_elven.0036.b.tt:0 "You request Gimli to sail west to Valinor together.\nYou continue as Thranduil."
 01_elven.0036.c:0 "No, my place is here."
 01_elven.0036.c.tt:0 "You choose to stay in Middle-earth."
 01_elven.0037.t:0 "The Last Journey"
 01_elven.0037.desc:0 "The boat is finished. Crafted by my own hands beneath Ithilien’s green boughs, it is light upon the water, yet sturdy enough for the long voyage ahead. The Anduin carries me past the lands of Men, past the cities of stone and the fields of golden grain. The wind fills the sail, the scent of salt grows stronger, and at last, I see the open Sea before me.\n\nThe sun sets upon Middle-earth, and in its fading light, I pass beyond sight, bound for the shores of Valinor."
 01_elven.0037.a:0 "Into the West"
 01_elven.0037.a.tt:0 "Legolas and Gimli sail west, answering the call to Valinor."
 01_elven.0037.b:0 "Into the West"
 01_elven.0037.b.tt:0 "You continue as the Elves in Emyn Arnen."
 01_elven.0038.t:0 "An Invitation to the West"
 01_elven.0038.desc:0 "I sit in the quiet of the Glittering Caves, the sound of hammers and the hum of dwarven voices a familiar backdrop to my thoughts. The weight of the years is heavy upon my shoulders, the passing of time marking each moment with a quiet reminder of all that has changed. The funeral of Elessar still echoes in my heart, the weight of his passing sitting like a stone in my chest. His death marks the end of an era, one of the last great men of Middle-earth.\nAs I pause, a courtier arrives, handing me a letter sealed with the emblem of Greenwood. The familiar script of Legolas is unmistakable. I break the seal and unfold the parchment, reading the words written by my dearest friend, the elf who had once been at my side through the most perilous of times. The letter speaks of the passing of Elessar, of the waning of Middle-earth, and, most importantly, of the call to sail west to Valinor.\n\n#help 'I have long walked this land with you, Master Dwarf, Legolas writes. The time has come for me to leave these shores and sail west, but I cannot do so without extending an invitation to you, my friend, to join me. It is a great honour, one few are granted, to journey to the Undying Lands. There, you may gaze upon the timeless halls of the Valar and once again behold the beauty of Galadriel, the Lady who has always held your heart. I would not leave without you by my side.'#!\n\nI pause, the weight of the letter sinking in. To sail to Valinor would be an honour beyond measure. It is a chance to see the Lady Galadriel once more, to be in a land of beauty and peace, untouched by the troubles of Middle-earth. But would it be right to leave my kin, the dwarves of the Glittering Caves, to go to a place where even the memory of my own people might fade? Could I truly leave the place where I have built I life?"
 01_elven.0038.a:0 "I will go, and sail with you to the Undying Lands."
 01_elven.0038.a.tt:0 "You choose to sail west with Legolas, answering the call to Valinor.\nYou continue as Wirwir."
 01_elven.0038.b:0 "I will stay. Middle-earth still needs me."
 01_elven.0038.b.tt:0 "You stay amongst your people in the Glittering Caves of Aglarond."
 01_elven.0039.t:0 "The Last Journey Together"
 01_elven.0039.desc:0 "Side by side, as ever. The boat glides over the Anduin, its wooden frame steady beneath the weight of old friends. The lands of Men pass by, their towers and fields shrinking into memory. The scent of salt grows in the wind, and the open Sea beckons ahead. Gimli sits beside Legolas, cradling a small crystal, the glint of golden strands encased within catching the final rays of sunlight.\n\n#help 'What will become of the Lady’s gift, Master Dwarf?'#! Legolas says, eyes on the horizon. \nGimli chuckles, running a calloused finger over the boat's edge. \n#help 'A treasure beyond price, Elf, which I shall cherish in my heart as long as I am able, but I had promised the Fair Lady that it would endure an heirloom of my people.\nIt warms my heart to know I shall soon set eyes upon her once again in Valinor. Then, she will know I have kept my word to her.'#!\n\nThe sun dips below the waves. Together, they pass beyond sight, bound for the Undying Lands."
 01_elven.0039.a:0 "Together, into the West!"
 01_elven.0039.a.tt:0 "Legolas and Gimli sail west, answering the call to Valinor.\n\nYou (Legolas) continue as Thranduil."
 01_elven.0039.b:0 "Together, into the West!"
 01_elven.0039.b.tt:0 "Legolas and Gimli sail west, answering the call to Valinor.\n\nYou (Legolas) continue as the Elves in Emyn Arnen."
 01_elven.0040.t:0 "A Long Road Ahead"
 01_elven.0040.desc:0 "The Sea calls, but I have chosen to remain. I cannot bring myself to abandon [middleearth|E], the land that has shaped me, where the bonds of friendship and kinship endure. I stay, resolute in my place, carrying the weight of memories and the legacy of those who walked beside me.\n\nThough the world grows quieter and the lands more empty, my purpose is not yet finished. The echoes of the past, the deeds of the Fellowship, still stir within me. The land of Men may yet need my counsel, and my strength remains to guide them. A long road lies ahead, and I will walk it with resolve, knowing that my place is still here, among the living, under the stars of [middleearth|E]."
 01_elven.0040.a:0 "I shall remain, for [middleearth|E] is still my home."
 01_elven.0040.a.tt:0 "You choose to stay in [middleearth|E]."
