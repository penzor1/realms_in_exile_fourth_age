 01_elven.0036.t:0 "The Sea's Call" # Legolas Intro # By Jagua
 01_elven.0036.desc:0 "Elessar has passed, and the weight of his loss settles upon Legolas like a shadow. He recalls the many roads they walked together, the battles fought, the hardships endured side by side. The Fellowship, once united by oaths and deep friendship, now lies scattered across the lands. Boromir has long passed into memory, and so too have Peregrin and Meriadoc. Mithrandir, Frodo, Sam, and Bilbo have sailed across the Sea, leaving only echoes of their deeds and the warmth of their shared days. Gimli, steadfast and loyal, still walks the land, one of the last of the Fellowship to remain, his bond with Legolas unbroken.\n\nThe call of the West stirs in Legolas’s heart, but the thought of leaving without his dearest friend, without the companionship that saw them through so much, fills him with sorrow. Could he truly walk the shores of Valinor alone? Or does [middleearth|E] yet hold a purpose, something worth staying for?"
 01_elven.0036.a:0 "The Sea calls, and I must answer!"
 01_elven.0036.a.tt:0 "You choose to sail west to Valinor alone."
 01_elven.0036.b:0 "I will go, and Gimli shall join me!"
 01_elven.0036.b.tt:0 "You request Gimli to sail west to Valinor together."
 01_elven.0036.c:0 "No, my place is here."
 01_elven.0036.c.tt:0 "You choose to stay in [middleearth|E]."
 01_elven.0037.t:0 "The Last Journey"
 01_elven.0037.desc:0 "The boat is finished. Crafted by my own hands beneath Ithilien’s green boughs, it is light upon the water, yet sturdy enough for the long voyage ahead. The Anduin carries me past the lands of [men|E], past the cities of stone and the fields of golden grain. The wind fills the sail, the scent of salt grows stronger, and at last, I see the open Sea before me.\n\nThe sun sets upon [middleearth|E], and in its fading light, I pass beyond sight, bound for the shores of Valinor."
 01_elven.0037.a:0 "Into the West"
 01_elven.0037.a.tt:0 "You sail west, answering the call to Valinor.\n\nYou (Legolas) continue as Thranduil."
 01_elven.0037.b:0 "Into the West"
 01_elven.0037.b.tt:0 "You sail west, answering the call to Valinor.\n\nYou (Legolas) continue as the Elves in Emyn Arnen."
 01_elven.0038.t:0 "An Invitation to the West"
 01_elven.0038.desc:0 "I sit in the quiet of the Glittering Caves, the sound of hammers and dwarven voices familiar to my thoughts. The weight of years presses upon me, marked by change. Elessar’s funeral still lingers, his passing a stone upon my chest. His death ends an era, one of the last great men of [middleearth|E].\n\nA messenger arrives with a letter sealed by Greenwood, unmistakably from Legolas. I break the seal and read the words of my dear friend, the elf who once stood beside me in peril. He writes of Elessar’s passing, the fading of [middleearth|E], and the call to sail west.\n#help ‘I have long walked this land with you, Master Dwarf,’#!\nLegolas writes,\n#help ‘The time has come for me to leave, but I cannot go without inviting you. It is a great honour to journey to the Undying Lands, where you may again behold Lady Galadriel. I would not leave without you.’#!\nTo sail to Valinor would be a tremendous honour. Peace, untouched by [middleearth|E]’s troubles. Yet could I really leave behind the Glittering Caves and the life I've built here?"
 01_elven.0038.a:0 "I will go, and sail with you to the Undying Lands."
 01_elven.0038.a.tt:0 "You choose to sail west with Legolas, answering the call to Valinor.\n\nYou continue as Wirwir 'Glitterbeard'."
 01_elven.0038.b:0 "I will stay. [middleearth|E] still needs me."
 01_elven.0038.b.tt:0 "You stay amongst your people in the Glittering Caves of Aglarond."
 01_elven.0039.t:0 "The Last Journey Together"
 01_elven.0039.desc:0 "Side by side, as ever. The boat glides over the Anduin, its wooden frame steady beneath the weight of old friends. The lands of Men pass by, their towers and fields shrinking into memory. The scent of salt grows in the wind, and the open Sea beckons ahead. Gimli sits beside Legolas, cradling a small crystal, the glint of golden strands encased within catching the final rays of sunlight.\n\n#help 'I see you have brought the Lady’s gift, Master Dwarf,'#! Legolas says, eyes on the horizon. \nGimli chuckles, running a calloused finger over the heirloom. \n#help 'A treasure beyond price, Elf, which I shall cherish as long as I am able.\nIt warms my heart to know I shall soon set eyes upon the Fair Lady once again in Valinor. There she shall see I have kept my word to her.'#!\n\nThe sun dips below the waves. Together, they pass beyond sight, bound for the Undying Lands."
 01_elven.0039.a:0 "Together, into the West!"
 01_elven.0039.a.tt:0 "You sail west, answering the call to Valinor.\n\nYou (Legolas) continue as Thranduil."
 01_elven.0039.b:0 "Together, into the West!"
 01_elven.0039.b.tt:0 "You sail west, answering the call to Valinor.\n\nYou (Legolas) continue as the Elves in Emyn Arnen."
 01_elven.0040.t:0 "A Long Road Ahead"
 01_elven.0040.desc:0 "The Sea calls, but I have chosen to remain. I cannot bring myself to abandon [middleearth|E], the land that has shaped me, where the bonds of friendship and kinship endure. I stay, resolute in my place, carrying the weight of memories and the legacy of those who walked beside me.\n\nThough the world grows quieter and the lands more empty, my purpose is not yet finished. The echoes of the past, the deeds of the Fellowship, still stir within me. The land of Men may yet need my counsel, and my strength remains to guide them. A long road lies ahead, and I will walk it with resolve, knowing that my place is still here, among the living, under the stars of [middleearth|E]."
 01_elven.0040.a:0 "I shall remain, for [middleearth|E] is still my home."
 01_elven.0040.a.tt:0 "You choose to stay in [middleearth|E]."
