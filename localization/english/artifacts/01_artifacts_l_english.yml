And all eyes followed his gaze, and behold! upon the foremost ship a great standard broke, and the wind displayed it as she turned towards the Harlond. There flowered a White Tree, and that was for Gondor; but Seven Stars were about it, and a high crown above it, the signs of Elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count. And the stars flamed in the sunlight, for they were wrought of gems by Arwen daughter of Elrond; and the crown was bright in the morning, for it was wrought of mithril and gold.'#!\n - Éomer spotting Arwen’s Standard of Gondor, from the battlefield of Pelennor."

It was cleaved in two by the Uruk leader Lurtz, as Boromir valiantly defended the Halflings Merry and Pippin.\n\nThe horn was crafted before the line of the Kings of [gondor|E] was broken, when Vorondil the Hunter, father of Mardil [Glossary('Voronwë','voronwe_gloss')], hunted the wild Kine of [Glossary('Araw','araw_gloss')] in the far fields of Rhûn. It is said that if it were to be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of [gondor|E], as the realm was of old, its voice will not pass unheeded. The Great Horn is an heirloom of the house of Stewards, traditionally borne by their firstborn."
