The Third Age of the world is ended, and the new age is begun; and it is your task to order its beginning and to preserve what must be preserved. For though much has been saved, much must now pass away; and the power of the Three Rings also is ended. And all the lands that you see, and those that lie round about them, shall be dwellings of Men. For the time comes of the Dominion of Men, and the Elder Kindred shall fade or depart.'#!\n - Gandalf the White, to King Elssar."
 #"Over a century after the Dark Lord was felled, Middle-Earth is at ease. The Elves retired to their forest domains, Dwarves to their mountain holds, and the last dastardly Orcs now cower in the deepest holes of the earth. The age of men has come, an age of prosperity and glory.\n\nBut there are whispers of odd things growing in the corners of the world. Of men, attracted by ill-arts and of powers from beyond the pale. Of powermongering lords, communing in dark rituals. They even talk of groans answering back from the shadow and fire...\n\nBe wary, for groans can turn to growls."
