 hill_troll_desc:0 "#size:15    Hill Trolls could be encountered in the wilderlands of [middleearth|E]. Like most trolls, they were exceptionally stupid by most standards.

 cave_troll_desc:0 "#size:15    Cave Trolls could only be encountered deep beneath the mountains of [middleearth|E].

 snow_troll_desc:0 "#size:15    Snow Trolls could only be encountered in the furthest northern reaches of [middleearth|E], where [angband|E] once stood. They were exceptionally rare, and only a handful of them were known to roam in the expansive frozen plains and tundra of Forodwaith.#!"
 black_troll_desc:0 "#size:15    The Olog-hai, or Black Trolls, were brutal war machines bred by [sauroncharacter|E] to bolster the armies of [mordor|E]. They were marginally more intelligent than most trolls. They were the only servants of the eye to truly adopt Black Speech as their dominant language, taking pride in the use of the Dark Lord's tongue.#!"
 sand_troll_desc:0 "#size:15    Sand Trolls could be encountered in the far south of [middleearth|E]. Few of them were known to live in the arid drylands of [harad|E] and the dense jungles of the [bayoftulwang|E], and perhaps further beyond in the Utter South.#!"
